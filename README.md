# RadioApp

### Simple Radio Player for Elderly People

This application is specially designed to work with Android 5.1.1 to run on Samsung Galaxy J5. 

My grandmother is 86 years old right now, and she does not know how to use a smartphone. So we designed a simple radio app that sends a permanent notification. 

With this simple approach, she only has to wake the phone up by pressing the phone's main button. And then she can easily open and close the radio by pressing the big red power button, traverse through radio channels by pressing blue buttons, and adjust the volume by pressing the yellow buttons.

#### Dependencies
